#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering  is the process of applying engineering principles and methods to design,develop and maintain highy quality software systems


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
development of first programming language fortran in 1957
adoption of AI and machine learning like google TensorFlow in 2015
release of open source linux in 1991

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirement analysis-to gather functional and non functional needs from stakeholders
sytem design-plan the architecture of the software based on the needs
implementation/coding-write the code for the software
testing-verify that the software meets the needs and is defect free
deployment-release software for use by end users
maintenace-provide updates to the software after release
review and evaluation-evaluate the success and performance of the software projectw

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall meyhodology follows a sequential approach where each phase of the software development must be completed before the next one begins like designing a banking system while agile methodology is where development occurs in small cycles which each cycle ending with a potential product increment like creating a mobile app for a startup

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software developer-designs the software,writes the code for software applications,debuggs and troubleshoots the software
quality assurance engineer-develops test palns to show the scope and schedule for testing,executes test cases and records results,identify defects during testing and asses software performance
project manager-creates a detailed plan and project schedule,budget management,team leader to ensure collaboration and completes and closes project once done

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDES provide tools in a single app like debbuggers,editorst that help developers write code more efficiently example; virtual studio code and eclipse
version control sytems allows developers to track changes in the codebase overtime and allows collaboration between developers example Git


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
quality assurance problem-solved by robustly testing the software
security issues-solved  by following security code practices and implementing security measures like encryption
rapid changes in technology-solved by continously learning,training and staying informed

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit testing checks out individual components of a software in isolation
intergration tests the interaction of different components to ensure they work together as expected
system testing validates the complete system to ensure it works as intended 
acceptance testing verifies that the software satistfies the acceptance criteria of the stakeholders or customers

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is the process of creating a a clear,specific and concise instruction for an artificial intelligence in order to get the most correct output

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague prompt- what is software engineering
better prompt- as a software engineer,explain what is software engineering to a university student from africa and include images
